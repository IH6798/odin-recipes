    <h3 class="fishandchips-desc">Description</h3>
    <p>Fish and chips is a beloved comfort food, known for its crispy, golden coating and tender fish inside. The combination of freshly fried fish with perfectly crispy chips is irresistible, making it a popular takeaway dish in many countries. When made at home, it's even better, with the option to adjust seasoning and fry everything to your liking</p>
    <p class="second-desc">The key to a great fish and chips meal is the batter's crispiness and the chips' perfect textureâ€”soft inside, crispy outside. Add a squeeze of lemon and a side of tartar sauce for an extra burst of flavor!</p>
