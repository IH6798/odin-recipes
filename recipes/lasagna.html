        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
        <p>Lasagna is a hearty Italian dish made of layers of pasta, rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and melted cheese. The meat sauce is made with ground beef or pork, tomatoes, and spices, while the béchamel sauce is a smooth, creamy white sauce. Layers of these components are assembled, then baked until golden and bubbly</p>
